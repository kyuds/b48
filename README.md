# b48
A 2048 game implementation written purely in bashscript. Since the random "2" placement was generated via `gshuf`, if `coreutils` is not installed on your machine, you will need to install it:
```
brew install coreutils
```
Currently only supports WASD keys and Q to quit. 

### TODO
- [ ] Arrow-key command support
- [ ] View of final board
- [ ] Refactor repetitive logic
