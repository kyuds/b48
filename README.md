### MacOS 2048 BashScript
A 2048 game implementation written purely in bashscript. Since the random "2" placement was generated via `gshuf`, if `coreutils` is not installed on your machine, you will need to install it via `brew install coreutils`. To play, run the `install.sh` script and type `2048` into your computer! WASD keys for commands!

### TODO
- [ ] Arrow-key support
- [ ] View of final board
